# Jedi: Fallen Order

This is just a simple index that i made, inspired by the [EA Jedi: Fallen Order](https://www.ea.com/es-es/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-fallen-order)
page to practice tailwind.  

* Installed it via postCSS
* Made some custom styles
* Optimized using a script to have only the necessary styles

Definitely, this is harder than bootstrap...

Anyways! You can visit the page [here](https://sami-sopas.github.io/Fallen-Order/)
